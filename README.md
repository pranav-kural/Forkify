## Dev notes

This site has been built primarily for learning purposes, using pure JavaScript. No frontend or backend framework has been used. No HTTP library or framework has been used either for routing etc.
Parcel v2 has been used as the primary bundler, to build the production build pack deployed on [Netlify](https://projectforkify.netlify.app/) and also for bundling the application and running it during developement.

API used: https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2

Other project related details could be found (& configured) in the _config.js_ file.

## Side notes

> Although this project was built as part of [Jonas's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course), I've implemented a different approach in a lot of sections (like in the way the Views are organized and data is passed among them), so the code is quite a bit different and modified.

Please feel free to use any or all parts of this project as you'd like, but keep in mind to credit Jonas (original creator of the project) and not use it as your own.
